\section MainPageIntro Introduction

NiftyCal is a software library to perform
video camera calibration, and is largely based on OpenCV (e.g. 2.4.11), with non-linear optimisers provided by ITK (e.g. 4.7.1).

NiftyCal provides:
\li 2D and 3D structures that store each point along with its identifier.
\li A simple IPoint2DDetector interface that all point detectors implement.
\li A range of IPoint2DDetector implementations including chessboards, asymmetrical circle grids,
<a href="http://github.com/NifTK/apriltags">AprilTags</a>, and template matching of dots and rings.
\li Mono and stereo camera calibration using <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/888718/">Zhang's 2000</a> method
(normal OpenCV method), built from the ground-up to work with different numbers of points per view.
\li Mono and stereo camera calibrations using <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1087109/">Tsai's 1987</a>
method, that works with a single view of a either a coplanar or non-coplanar model.
\li Mono and stereo camera calibration using iterative refinement of control points, as in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2009.5457474">Datta 2009</a>.
\li Hand-eye calibration using a direct matrix multiplication method as in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2002.806597">Shahidi 2002</a>.
\li Hand-eye calibration using linear least-squares as in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/70.34770">Tsai 1989</a>.
\li Hand-eye calibration using non-linear minimisation as in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rcs.1478">Malti 2013</a>.
\li Timing calibration, that correlates two series of timestamped samples, both representing the same physical movment.
\li Performance enhancements using OpenMP.
