/**
\page UCLRequirementsTraceability Requirements Traceability

All traceable requirements are identified with a unique requirements identifier.
The identifier has the following naming convention:

\verbatim
REQ-<Project Code>-<Document Type>-<Document ID>-<Number>-<Version>
\endverbatim

where

<table>
<tr><td>Project Code:</td><td>Four digit number allocated to the project with leading zeros to facilitate searching and sorting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Document Type:</td><td>The two or three letter code of the document. e.g. Component Specification Document (CSD)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Document ID:</td><td>Four digit number allocated to the document with leading zeros to facilitate searching and sorting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number:</td><td>A three digit number allocated to that specific requirement
with leading zeros to facilitate searching and sorting.
It is not necessary for numbers to be contiguous. If requirements are removed,
existing requirements should maintain their numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Version:</td><td>A two digit number allocated to the version of that requirement with leading zeros to facilitate search and sorting, incremented
only for substantive change to a requirement. It is not incremented for clarifications or rewording.</td></tr>
</table>
